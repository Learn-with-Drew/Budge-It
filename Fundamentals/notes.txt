    - focus on components, props, state, effects

    - components
        - react apps are made up of components
            - self-contained, reusable snippets of code, modular
            - can add, update, delete components without touching the rest of the application
        - its a piece of the UI and has its own logic and appearance
        - basically javascript functions that return markup 
        - ie. function MyButton(){
            return (<button>im a button </button>);
        }
        - with this new button component, can nest into another component
        - ie. export default function App(){
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1> MY APP </h1>
                    <MyButton />  <---- React component because it starts with a capital letter
                </div>
            )
        }

    - props (https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component)
        - What are props? 
            - pieces of information or properties, or passing in custom arguments to change the behavior of components or what is visibly shown on the page when rendered
        - can pass down props from parent components to child components
            - one-way data flow
        - props are passed as objects
            - can use destructuring on props
        - to use props, needs to be inside {}
            - ie. function Header(props){
                return <h1>{props.title}</h1>
            }
            - inside the h1 tags, has props in {}

    - State and Event Handlers
        - Events
            - can handle events by putting an event handler inside the component
            - ie. ((inside MyButton))
                - function handleClick(){
                    alert ("button clicked");
                }
            -  ((inside return of MyButton))
                - <button onClick={handleClick}>im a button</button>
        - State
            - any information in the UI that changes overtime, usually triggered by user interaction
                - ie. likes/dislike button
