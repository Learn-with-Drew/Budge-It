    - focus on components, props, state, effects

    - components
        - react apps are made up of components
        - its a piece of the UI and has its own logic and appearance
        - basically javascript functions that return markup 
        - ie. function MyButton(){
            return (<button>im a button </button>);
        }
        - with this new button component, can nest into another component
        - ie. export default function App(){
            return (
                <div>
                    <h1> MY APP </h1>
                    <MyButton />  <---- React component because it starts with a capital letter
                </div>
            )
        }

    - events
        - can handle events by putting an event handler inside the component
        - ie. ((inside MyButton))
            - function handleClick(){
                alert ("button clicked");
            }
        -  ((inside return of MyButton))
            - <button onClick={handleClick}>im a button</button>

    - props
        - What are props? 
            - pieces of information or properties, or passing in custom arguments to change the behavior of components or what is visibly shown on the page when rendered
        - 

    - states

    - effects
